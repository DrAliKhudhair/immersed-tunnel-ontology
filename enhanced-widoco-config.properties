# Enhanced Descriptions
abstract=Comprehensive ontology for immersed tunnel engineering aligned with IFC4.3 standards, featuring modular architecture with 19 specialized modules covering all aspects of tunnel design, construction, operation, and maintenance. This enhanced version includes detailed examples, use cases, and comprehensive cross-references.

description=This ontology represents a complete knowledge model for immersed tunnel engineering projects, designed to support IFC4.3 standardization efforts. The modular architecture includes: (1) Foundation modules for core concepts, taxonomy, mereology, and properties; (2) System modules for safety/emergency, mechanical/electrical, drainage/utilities, monitoring/instrumentation, facilities, and traffic/transportation; (3) Technical modules for engineering design, construction processes, site/environmental systems, geotechnical foundations, structural systems and components, materials/quality systems, maintenance/operations, and spatial extensions. Each module is fully integrated with comprehensive relationships and constraints.

# Documentation Enhancement
includeIntroduction=true
introduction=This ontology serves as a comprehensive knowledge representation for immersed tunnel engineering, specifically designed to support IFC4.3 standardization efforts. Immersed tunnels represent one of the most complex engineering challenges in modern infrastructure, requiring careful coordination of multiple disciplines including geotechnical engineering, structural design, marine construction, environmental protection, and safety systems.
