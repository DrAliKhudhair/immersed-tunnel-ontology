<span class="markdown">
      Immersed tunnel engineering ontology optimized for IFC4.3 schema development.
      
      STREAMLINED FOR IFC4.3 CONTRIBUTION:
      - Reduced to 19 modules (removed individuals, insufficient, and placeholder modules)
      - Pure engineering concepts focused on standardization
      - Eliminated abstract modeling frameworks and minimal placeholder modules
      - Comprehensive coverage of foundational construction methodology differences
      - Ready for direct mapping to IFC entities and property sets
      - Clean modular architecture with foundation + domain modules
      
      STRUCTURE:
      - 4 Foundation Modules: Core semantic infrastructure
      - 15 Domain Modules: Optimized functional areas with substantial content
      - Zero abstract frameworks or example instances
      - Enhanced for schema development and standardization
      
      IFC4.3 FOCUS AREAS:
      - Immersed tunnel elements (standard, transition, special elements)
      - Marine construction systems (buoyancy control, temporary systems)
      - Lifecycle management and construction phases
      - Spatial zones and tolerance modeling
      - Engineering analysis and validation systems
      
      COVERAGE: Complete support for sections 3.4 and 3.5 requirements.
      STANDARDS: Full compliance with immersed tunnel engineering practices.
      IFC-READY: Prepared for buildingSMART standardization process.
